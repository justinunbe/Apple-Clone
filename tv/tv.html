        <p class="watch-the-films-paragraph">TV is a major part of our lives. We gather together around our big screens to watch big shows and big events. Yet somehow, the overall experience of TV has continued to stagnate. Until now. It all starts by
            recognizing that apps are the future of television. HBO NOW, WatchESPN, Netflix, Hulu, iTunes — apps are quickly becoming how we watch today. So we built a foundation around this vision — with an operating system called tvOS, innovative ways to
            connect with your screen, and a smart use of Siri to search for something to watch. This is Apple TV. And this is where television is headed.</p>
